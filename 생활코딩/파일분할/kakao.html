    <h1>Kakao</h1>
    <p>
        Kakao (Korean: 카카오) is a South Korean Internet company that was established in 2010. It formed as a result of a merger between Daum Communications and the original Kakao Inc. In 2014, the company was renamed Daum Kakao.[2] The company rebranded once more in 2015, reverting simply to Kakao from Daum Kakao.[3]

        In May 2015, the company acquired Path, an American social media company that had become successful in Indonesia.[4] In January 2016, Kakao acquired a 76.4% stake in LOEN Entertainment, a large South Korean entertainment company, for $1.5 billion.[5] It was later rebranded as Kakao M. The company has gained further prominence from KakaoTalk, a free mobile instant messaging application for smartphones with free text and free call features. By May 2017, the app had 220 million registered users and 47 million active monthly users.[6]
